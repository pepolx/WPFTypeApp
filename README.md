# Typing Practice Application

## Description

The Typing Practice Application is a .NET-based desktop application developed with WPF and XAML. It offers an engaging way to improve typing skills through a user-friendly interface where players type out randomly generated sentences. The application provides real-time feedback by highlighting correctly typed characters in green and mistakes in red, allowing for immediate error correction.

## Purpose

This application serves a dual purpose:
1. **Skill Improvement:** It aims to assist users in enhancing their typing speed and accuracy.
2. **Learning Experience:** The primary goal is to facilitate my understanding of WPF, XAML, and general .NET concepts to further my development skills in these areas.

## Features

- **Random Text Generation:** Each session presents a unique typing challenge with a randomly generated sentence.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Typing accuracy is visually indicated with each keystroke, promoting a quick learning cycle.
- **Game Control:** Users can start over with a new sentence at any point, offering continuous practice.
- **Mistake Correction:** The backspace key allows users to correct their typos and proceed with their practice.

## Future Enhancements

- **Scoring System:** A scoring feature will be added to quantify user performance in terms of typing accuracy and speed.
- **Expanded Vocabulary:** The application will be enhanced with an extensive list of words to increase the challenge and educational value.
- **Customizable Difficulty:** Users will be able to select difficulty levels to match their proficiency, ensuring a tailored typing experience.

## Learning Outcomes

By developing this application, I aim to deepen my expertise in:
- WPF frameworks and their application in creating responsive UIs.
- XAML for designing user interfaces in .NET applications.
- .NET best practices for structuring and implementing application logic.
